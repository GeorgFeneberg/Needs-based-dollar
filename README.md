🏛️ Needs-Based Dollar (NBD) & Variable Sales Tax Rate (VSTR) Framework

📜 Open Economic License v1.0

🔷 Summary

This repository introduces the Needs-Based Dollar (NBD) monetary framework and its core mechanism—the Variable Sales Tax Rate (VSTR)—designed to replace traditional income and corporate taxation with a real-time, self-balancing fiscal engine.

Instead of taxing productivity or borrowing into inflation, NBD funds public services through luxury consumption and net trade surpluses, while dynamically stabilizing the money supply based on population and spending behavior.

💡 Core Concepts

MSR (Money Supply-to-Population Ratio): Anchors system stability

VSTR (Variable Sales Tax Rate): Automatically adjusts based on public spending, luxury demand (LPS), and trade flows

Tiered Tax Structure: Progressive, behavior-sensitive taxes only on luxury goods/services

Net Trade Offset: VSTR is reduced when exports exceed imports

Public Spending Multiplier: More needs-based spending → more luxury spending → stabilizes the system
